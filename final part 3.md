## Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

First, my classmates gave me structural advice.
1. navigation was inserted to help fast-move and skip parts that the audience may not be interested in.
2. Pics or vizs were designed in simple and straightforward ways to best service my content.
3. I narrowed some of the data sets to eliminate excessive information. 

TA and professor gave me valuable and practical suggestions for me. 
1. Prof reminded me of some images about copyright protection, I removed some of the images and added more citations for data sources in all the data viz. He also pointed out that my last part had a weak link to my content and could not give a solution to my audience. Instead of giving datasets about WWF or IFAW, I illustrated a successful animal-protected product and called people to choose eco-friendly products in their daily lives. 

2. AS suggested I change/ add a subtitle for the data conclusion. For example, the decreasing elephant numbers. An obvious subtitle can let my readers get the conclusion immediately without reading the whole paragraph. Similarly, more subtitles were added when I thought reading would be time-consuming or I wanted the audience to know the information quickly.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.


The interviews with the audience have revealed that not only those interested in animal conservation but also the general public can be my target readers. On the one hand, this is because my content is not difficult to read, with a straightforward storyline. On the other hand, the solution I propose at the end is related to daily life and is something people can easily implement. 

However, individuals who care about the environment and biodiversity are evidently more likely to click into my story.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

In Part 1, I primarily focused on the CITES database but somewhat explained the dataset. Consequently, the data visualization designs were largely abandoned. This taught me that when undertaking a project, the initial direction is often the most crucial. Without a clear overarching focus, subsequent work, even if completed in advance, may lack value.

In Part 2, I narrowed down the data to a well-known animal, elephants. I introduced more datasets for multidimensional storytelling. Through interviews with friends, I received some modification suggestions regarding Shorthand. Objective audiences helped me discover aspects I had overlooked, such as rapid navigation during browsing, interactive maps, and the presentation of images.

In the final part of the project, I optimized the presentation of various types of images, utilizing multiple visualization tools, including but not limited to PowerPoint, Excel, Tableau, and iFlourish. The format of the text is also an integral part of the overall story, with color and font aiding in conveying crucial information. Lastly, I made modifications to the text citations, supplementing or revising certain wording, and adjusting the sources of the databases.

## References
> You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story - if so, you can probably skip this section.  Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary.  If you do this, you probably want to include a link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I believe that observing more data visualizations and stories can help me better articulate my own narrative. After watching presentations from several classmates, even though each presentation was only a brief minute, I witnessed a variety of storytelling styles. Some individuals focused on the education sector, while others chose food as their theme, resulting in different styles and designs influenced by the seriousness of their topics. 

I also discovered that the quantity of information does not necessarily determine the quality of a story. I recall a story about the Metropolitan Museum of Art where, despite using only one visualization chart, the logical progression of status-conflict-resolution was comprehensive, convincing, and visually appealing. While I utilized multiple databases, I also recognize the issue of lack of focus in my own storytelling.

How to concisely and intuitively convince the audience to accept our message needs more practice. If I have the opportunity, I am willing to apply the techniques and ideas learned in this class to my future study or work.
