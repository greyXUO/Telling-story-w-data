## Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

First, my classmates gave me structural advice.
1. navigation was inserted to help fast-move and skip parts that the audience may not be interested in.
2. Pics or vizs were designed in simple and straightforward ways to best service my content.
3. I narrowed some of the data sets to eliminate excessive information. 

Both our TAs gave me valuable and practical suggestions for me. 
1. CG reminded me of some images about copyright protection, I removed some of the images and added more citations for data sources in all the data viz. CG also pointed out that my last part had a weak link to my content and could not give a solution to my audience. Instead of giving datasets about WWF or IFAW, I illustrated a successful animal-protected product and called people to choose eco-friendly products in their daily lives. 

2. AS suggested I change/ add a subtitle for the data conclusion. For example, the decreasing elephant numbers. An obvious subtitle can let my readers get the conclusion immediately without reading the whole paragraph. Similarly, more subtitles were added when I thought reading would be time-consuming or I wanted the audience to know the information quickly.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## References
> You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story - if so, you can probably skip this section.  Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary.  If you do this, you probably want to include a link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.
