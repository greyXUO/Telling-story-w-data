## Assignment 2: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
## Step 1: Choose and crituque
For step one, I choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday. (avoid using examples created by other students, etc.). 
The links to the available visualizations can be found at https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/. 

I chose <strong>2023/W8: The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein</strong>. https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8

## Step 2: critique the data visualization
Using the data visualization selected from step one, complete a critique the visualization, this time using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile.

<strong>Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? </strong>.

people who are muscle building or on diet. I think the viz is reachable cause it has an obvious title indicating the topic. The pics of products also make viz more attractive.

<strong>Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently? </strong>.

I like the idea that we can see the cheapest protein of everyday foods. It also provides calorie to help making decisions for muscle-building or diet people. However, the numbers of cal were at the wrong place and caused misleading. I would remove the calorie and rank the foods' price in ascending order.  

<strong>Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) </strong>.

Agreed. 2-dimension evaluation of conceptual and data driven is not enough to show the design part of viz. We can also evaluate our performance by aiming different audience, as different groups vary in scores. I would traverse the order to make chicken breast stands out.

## Step 3: sketch out a solution
