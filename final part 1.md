# Final Project Part 1
The final project will be your opportunity to put everything you've learned so far into action.  A core goal of the final project will be understanding your audience and ensuring you are communicating at an appropriate 
level, and telling the story using data visualization methods that are meaningful. Even though it's early in the class, I'd like you to start thinking now about what you'd like to do for your final project.  It's entirely 
fine if you want to change topics as we approach Part II in the later weeks.
